## Description
This project involves the development of a handwriting recognition model. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accurately identify handwritten digits and letters from images and converts them into text.

## Features
- Handwriting Recognition: The model can accurately identify handwritten digits and letters from images.
- Text Conversion: The identified handwritten digits and letters are converted into text.
## Technologies Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
## Future Scope
This project has immense potential in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and can be further improved to recognize complex handwritten documents.
